# Connect Four AI

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Connect 4 AI using **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** and **Iterative Deepening Search**. Plays on a 6Ã—7 grid where players drop discs to get four in a row. The AI blocks threats, creates winning opportunities, and adapts within a time limit.

## ðŸ›  Implementation

### Board Representation
- **NumPy matrix** (6Ã—7 grid)
- `0` = empty, `1` = Player, `2` = AI

### AI Algorithm
- **Minimax** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to reduce search space
- **Iterative Deepening** for balanced depth and performance
- **Center column prioritization** for strong opening moves
- Time-limited search to ensure quick AI responses

### Game Logic
- `do_move()` â€” Places disc in lowest empty row of chosen column
- `make_move()` â€” Updates board and switches turns
- `terminal()` â€” Detects wins (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and draws
- Input validation for player moves
